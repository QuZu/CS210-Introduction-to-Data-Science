# CS210-Introduction-to-Data-Science
Data science topics span a large variety of disciplines and require a collection of skills. This course
is intended to cover data science's fundamental principles and techniques, emphasizing data-centric
quantitative thinking. We will tour the basic data science techniques from manipulation and
summarizing the essential characteristics of a data set, basic statistical modeling, visualization,
and prediction.

*Learning outcomes:*

• Learning the fundamentals of data science pipeline

• Learning how to explore and experiment with data

• Learn basic statistics (sampling techniques, mean, variance, outliers, distributions) and machine learning techniques that are necessary to analyze data

• Perform statistical analysis on sample socio-economic data

• Building an understanding of data analytics techniques (data collection, cleaning, exploratory techniques, modeling, and presentation)

• Develop competency in the Python programming language within the course projects and assignments
